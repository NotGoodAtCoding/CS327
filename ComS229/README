For this final project, I had to implement quite a few new things. I first created a stack_type for objects, that way we could easily have stacks of objects in the dungeon. When the PC walked over one of these, the uppermost item would be picked up and stored in their stand_by items list. 

Next I implemented a prompt window that would display either the standby_list or the equiped_list along with options as needed. The standby and equiped items are stored in linked_lists, and are full copies of the objects, because when a new floor is generated, the original objects are re-generated. 

When an object is equiped, the PC's speed is updated. Because some of the dice can cause negative values, I floored the speed at 1 - so, when the PC's speed would normally go negative, I would cap it at 1.

When two monsters meet, the moving one displaces the neighboring monster to a neighboring space - if no neighboring space is available, then no movement for either monster is done.

When PC and Monster meet, PC's damage dice are rolled and tallied, then PC's hitpoints are deducted. if they fall below 0 (as per spec), then PC dies - game is over. If Monster's hitpoints fall below 0, monster is removed. If both are still alive, no movement occures. If PC has a weapon type equiped, then bare_hand damage set is not used.
