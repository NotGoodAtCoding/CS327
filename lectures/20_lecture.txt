Lecture 20

* C++
** Other differences from C
   C++ standard header files don't have a ".h" extension
   File extensions
   .cc, .cpp, .cxx, .c++, .C
   Compile with g++
   hello world...
** const
   C has const, but it's not used very much
   C++ uses it extensively
   Syntatically identical, but semantically different

   const int *p;        /* The addressed data cannot be changed   */
   int * const p;       /* The pointer variable cannot be changed */
   const int * const p; /* Neither can be changed                 */

   /* Suppose this is global: */
   const int i = 50;
   int a[i];

   const program...
** References
   int &r = i;
   After the above line, i and r are aliases
   must be assigned at the time they are created
   By convention, when changing a value inside a function, pass by address
   when not changing, pass by constant reference.
   swap program...
   functions can return references
** I/O
   iostream
   fstream
