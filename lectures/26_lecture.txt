* Useful C++ STL stuff
** ifstream
   ifstream i;
*** peek()
    i.peek();
    Allows you to look at the next character (byte) in the stream without
    removing it from the stream.
*** get()
    Returns and consumes the next character in the stream.
*** getline()
    Two getline()s in C++
    std::istream::getline()
      cin.getline(char *, int)
      string has to be big enough

      std::getline(cin, std::string &)
      uses a string object, which can grow.
*** operator>>()
    Skips leading whitespace, then reads until the next whitespace.
** stringstream
   Similar to Java's string builder.  Let's you use << to build strings.  Use
      str() to return a reference to a string.
** Containers
*** vector
    Similar to Java ArrayLists.
    Declare with templated (parametrized) type:
    vector<int> v;
*** Iterators
    inner class in a container or string:
    vector<int>::iterator vi;
    Initialize with begin(), iterate until end(), advance with ++, access
      with *
