* The four stages of compilation
* Declarations--variables and functions, storage class specifiers (const,
  volatile, etc.)
* Arrays
* Pointers, pointer arithmetic, and NULL
* sizeof operator
* Dynamic allocation
* The equivalence of pointers and arrays
* typedef
* Structs, enums, unions
* C strings
* File I/O
* Hexadecimal notation
* Endianness
* Bitwise operations and bitfields
* Preprocessing--#include, #define, #ifdef, #ifndef, etc., guards, macros,
  stringification and concatenation
* void * and generics
* Function pointers and jump tables
* goto
* The stack and the heap
* Variadic functions and macros
