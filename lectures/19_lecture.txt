Lecture 19
* Exam prep material
* Office hours
* C++
** Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 80s.
   He was working on a discrete event simulator, wanted an object oriented
   language, but also wanted speed.
   Originally known as "C with classes".
** Philosophy
   Retain as much of C as possible
   Strengthen type checking
   Add new features to make programming higher level
     References
     Classes
     Templates
     Exceptions
     Namespaces
     Function and operator overloading
     I/O changes
** Things you'll (probably) like
   C++ has bool
   // comments
   Variables can be defined anywhere
   Exceptions
   Objects
   Function-style casts (and some runtime casts)
     C style: (int) i
     C++ style: int(i)
   Semantic change in struct definitions
     structs also have public, private, and protected fields
     One is true bby default (public?  will verify)
** Things you (probably) won't like
   Things require casts that didn't before
   Lots of finicky error messages
** Things that aren't part of C++
   New data types (like string)
   Bounds checking
   Garbage collection
     But it has features that let you implement some of these things

Picking up here next time:

** Other differences
   C++ standard header files don't have a ".h" extension
   File extensions
   Compile with g++
** I/O
   iostream
   fstream
