Lecture 14

* More function pointers
** Function pointers as they are used in qsort() are often refered to as
   "callbacks" of "callback functions"
   Also very common in GUI programming.  You define a menu.  Something has to
   happen when the users selects the option, but that's inside the GUI
   library code, so that code needs a function pointer so that it can "call
   back" into your code to realize that functionality.
   Plugins
   Signal handlers

* A little tangent: When you start using curses, you'll block SIGINT (^C), so
   you'll need to "kill" rogue programs externally.

   kill - UNIX command
          kill takes the PID of your program and sends it an arbitrary signal
          Signal you want is SIGKILL (9)
          To get process ID, do "ps -fe <name>"
          kill -9 <pid>

** What's (faster|cleaner) than a bunch of if/else statements?
   Function tables.  See example program.
   
* Declarations
** Scope and lifetime
   Scope - Where in a program a variable is accessible
   Lifetime - when in a program a variable exists
** Keywords that alter declaration semantics
*** auto
    This is the default for variables defined in functions, so you very
    rarely see it used explicitly.  Variable's scope is restricted to the 
    function in which it is declared.  Lifetime is the same as that of the
    function. 
*** const
    Makes the variable immutable.  Doesn't affect scope or lifetime.
    Some compilers will put the variable in the text segment, which means
    that it's actual lifetime would be equal to that of the program; however,
    it would be an error to depend on this.
*** extern
    Means that the storage for the variable is created elsewhere; used to
    export data to other compilation units.  It only makes sense to use an
    external declaration for variables in global scope.
*** static
    In a function, changes the variables lifetime to be the lifetime of the
    program.  Scope is unaffected.
    On globals, prevents variable or function from being exported from the
    compilation unit.  This is useful for internal functions of an ADT.
    Think "private".
